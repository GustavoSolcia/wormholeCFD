# wormholeCFD

Supporting code from paper "Computational fluid dynamics in carbonate rock wormholes using magnetic resonance images as structural information". This repository contains image processing algorithms, OpenFOAM cases examples, and an implementation of a custom parabolic boundary condition. For further details, please read the manuscript. [MANUSCRIPT SENT TO REVIEW]

## How to use

The image processing codes should be used substituting the respective image paths in the files. There is a testSample for testing the image processing steps and a testCase for testing the OpenFOAM case and custom parabolic boundary condition.
